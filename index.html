      ## Finding the config


      ---

      ### Your config is either:

      --

      - in the default location `/usr/local/nginx/conf`

      -  where you specified it during the build

      ---

      ### I have no idea

      --
      ```bash
      $ nginx -t

      ```

      --

      ```bash
      nginx: the configuration file /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
      ```

      --
      (checks whether the config file is valid and exits)

      ---

      ### How do I use a different conf?

      ```bash
      $ nginx -c /home/user/nginx.conf
      ```

      ---

      layout: false
      class: center, middle

      # Syntax and default directives

      ---

      layout: true

      # Syntax and default directives
      ---


      ## What's a directive?

      --

      There are two types

      ---

      ### Simple directives

      ```
      name parameters semicolon
      ```

      --

      ```
      listen *:80;

      ```

      --

      There can be multiple parameters and they can be optional

      ---

      ### Context directives

      --

      ```
      name opening_curly
      simple directive
      simple directive
      closing_curly
      ```

      --

      ```
      server {
      listen *:80;
      server_name "";
      root /usr/share/nginx/html;
      }
      ```

      --

      Can be nested and provide something like inheritance

      ---

      ### Bare minimum

      --

      ```
      events {
      }

      http {
        server {
        }
      }
      ```

      ---

      ### Out of the box

      ```bash

      user nobody nogroup;
      worker_processes 1;

      events {
        worker_connections 512;
      }
      http {
        server {
          listen *:80;
          server_name "";
          root /usr/share/nginx/html;
        }
      }

      ```

      ---

      ## Some notes

      --

      There is an implicit main context

      --

      Inheritance direction is downward.

      --
      More curly embraces mean more specificity.


      ---

      ## The events context

      --

      Every worker process is single threaded with a non-blocking event loop.
      The events context tweaks it.

      --

      There can only be one.

      --

      It must be within the main context.

      ---

      ## Http and server context

      --

      Http context usually holds multiple server contexts

      --

      If multiple servers share directives, put them it the http context

      ---

      ## Whithin the server directive


      --

      ### listen

      --

      ### server_name

      --

      ### root

      layout: false
      class: center, middle

      # Static files and the location block

      ---

      layout: true

      #  Static files and the location block
      ---


      ---

      Config changes are not automatically picked up. You have to tell nginx to reload the config.

      ---

      serve static files

      ---


      layout: false

      Location blocks

      regex

      skipping regex

      naming
